# Kickstarter Projects Success Prediction (ML)

Leveraged advanced machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and GBM to supersede a Decision Tree model, achieving 97% accuracy and recall for multiclass outcomes. Utilized hyperparameter tuning to boost prediction accuracy to 98%. Applied Logistic Regression for multiclass classification and employed confusion matrix and ROC curves for effective performance visualization. Ensured model stability with a 5-fold cross-validation, maintaining a standard deviation below 0.05 in accuracy.
